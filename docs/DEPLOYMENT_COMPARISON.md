## Decision Matrix

### Choose App Platform If:
- [ ] You want the easiest deployment
- [ ] Your budget is under $50/month  
- [ ] You don't need complex infrastructure
- [ ] You want automatic scaling
- [ ] You prefer managed databases
- [ ] You want to focus on application code

### Choose Kubernetes If:
- [ ] You need fine-grained control
- [ ] You have complex scaling requirements
- [ ] Your team knows Kubernetes
- [ ] You need multi-region deployment
- [ ] You have budget >$75/month
- [ ] You need custom networking/security

### Choose Docker/Local If:
- [ ] You're developing or testing
- [ ] You need complete control
- [ ] You have existing server infrastructure
- [ ] Budget is very limited
- [ ] You're learning the technology

## Migration Path

You can start simple and upgrade as needed:

```
Docker/Local → App Platform → Kubernetes
     ↑              ↑             ↑
  Development   Production    Enterprise
```

### From Local to App Platform
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Run `./scripts/setup-app-platform.sh`
3. Configure GitHub secrets
4. Push to main branch

### From App Platform to Kubernetes
1. Export environment variables
2. Create Kubernetes manifests
3. Set up DOKS cluster
4. Deploy using CI/CD

## Cost Projections

### Traffic-based scaling costs:

| Monthly Users | App Platform | Kubernetes |
|---------------|--------------|------------|
| < 1,000       | $19         | $78        |
| 1,000-10,000  | $25-40      | $78-120    |
| 10,000-50,000 | $50-80      | $120-200   |
| 50,000+       | $100+       | $200+      |

*Note: Actual costs depend on usage patterns, database size, and resource requirements.*

## Recommendation

**For 90% of users: Start with App Platform**

1. **Begin** with App Platform for simplicity and cost-effectiveness
2. **Scale up** to Kubernetes only when you need advanced features
3. **Use Docker/Local** for development and testing

App Platform provides the best balance of simplicity, features, and cost for most web applications.
